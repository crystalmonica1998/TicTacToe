# TicTacToe
The game is played on a 3 by 3 grid.
Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
Players decide whether they want to be X or O. 
During a player's turn, the other player is not allowed to press on any square.
An X appears when pressing on the left mouse, and O appears when pressing on the right mouse.
The first player to get 3 marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
